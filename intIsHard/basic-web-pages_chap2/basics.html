    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
      <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
      <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
      headings: h1, h2, ..., h6, from highest to lowest.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
      <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is how you make an ordered list:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
            an ordered list</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
      <h3>emphasize&italian</h3>
      <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
      phrase.</p>
      <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
        of a word or phrase.</p>
      <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
      <p><em>notice:</em> Use html for separation, css is for presenting.</p>

      <h5>line breaks</h5>

      <h5>Horizontal Rule</h5>
      <hr/>
        <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
        soon.</p>
        <p>'/hr' carries less significance than the separation created by a new heading element, but more significance than a new paragraph.</p>
